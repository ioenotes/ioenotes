**Year**: I  
**Part**: II  

## Course Objectives

The primary goal of the course is to build the fundamental understanding of students on geometric properties of sections, material behavior, stress-strain relations, flexure, torsion, buckling and failure types in the structural elements due to external loads and temperature variations. After completing this course, students should be able to develop competency on material behavior and their analysis due to external loadings and temperature change, evaluate geometric properties of complex geometric figures and analyze structural members under flexure, shear, torsion and buckling.
