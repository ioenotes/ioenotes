## Course Objectives

To provide students with a deep understanding of the principles governing the behavior of fluids, encompassing both liquids and gases. This branch of physics and engineering aims to elucidate how fluids behave under various conditions and to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to analyze and solve practical problems related to fluid flow. It also enables students to apply fluid mechanics concepts to the design, analysis, and optimization of engineering systems involving fluids, such as pipelines, pumps, turbines and hydraulic systems.
