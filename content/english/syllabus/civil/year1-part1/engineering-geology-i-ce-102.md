**Lecture**: 2  
**Tutorial**: 0  
**Practical**: 1  
**Year**: I  
**Part**: I  

## Course Objectives

The course will provide the basic knowledge of engineering geology to the civil engineering students. Students will be able to understand the fundamental of engineering geology and various natural process and their influence on the surface as well as sub-surface features, identification of rocks and their significance, enhance the knowledge of mountain building process and importance in the field of civil engineering.

## Laboratory

1. Identification of common rock forming minerals (Quartz, Feldspar, Muscovite, Biotite, Chlorite, Calcite, Dolomite, Tourmaline, Pyrite, Talc, Fluorite, Apatite, Corundum, Diamond, Kyanite, Sillimanite, Garnet and clay minerals)  
2. Identification of rocks: Shale, Limestone, Sandstone, Siltstone, Conglomerate, Slate, Phyllite, Schist, Gneiss, Quartzite, Marble, Granite, Rhyolite, Gabbro, Basalt, Amphibolite, Syenite)  
3. Study of different geological structures in the block diagram  
4. Study of maps: Topographic and geological maps, construction of geological cross-section and their interpretation  

---

## Field Works (2 days)

A two-day fieldwork to provide practical on-site knowledge on preparation and interpretation of engineering geological mapping (measurement of geological plane using geological compass, identification of minerals and rocks, geomorphology, and geological structures etc). Students submit report after the fieldwork (Attendance in Fieldwork is Compulsory).
