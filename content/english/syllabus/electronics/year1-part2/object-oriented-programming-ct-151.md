---

### Tutorial
After completing each chapter some problems are solved and students are asked to solve programming problems with the teacher’s assistance.

---

### Assignment
Appropriate assignment problems are given to students after the completion of each chapter.

---

### Laboratory
There will be 9 labs covering all the course. At the end of the course students must submit a programming project on object oriented programming.

---

### Final Examination

| 2       | 5     | 7                   |
| 3       | 7     | 9                   |
| 4       | 5     | 7                   |
| 5       | 5     | 7                   |
| 6       | 4     | 5                   |
| 7       | 6     | 8                   |

| **Total** | **45** | **60**             |

*There may be minor deviation in marks distribution.*
