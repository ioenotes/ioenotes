## Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to train students with computer aided design and drafting of civil engineering structures. The course will teach students to extract dimensions from existing computer aided drawings, enabling them to interpret and utilize these drawings effectively. Students will be equipped to create drawings with site plans and structural details applying computer aided techniques to produce precise and professional documents for civil engineering projects.
