## Course Objectives

To provide students an introductory knowledge about the wide range of materials used in the construction of engineering projects. This course emphasizes on the property, defects, productions, preservation, alternatives and utilities of various civil engineering materials which would help in selection of the suitable materials for construction projects. This helps to build a base for the selection, adequate consideration and precautions in aspect of materials during design and construction.
