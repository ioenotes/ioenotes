## Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to introduce student to the fundamentals of surveying which is basic to all Civil Engineering Projects. In this course, specific emphasis will be given to plane surveying. This course provides basic knowledge of land measurement and surveying techniques to civil engineering students, and make them to learn and understand the theory and field procedures by applying suitable surveying methods to produce map.
