## Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to familiarize surveying methods and techniques used for design and construction of civil engineering projects. This course will provide basic knowledge of land measurement and surveying techniques giving specific emphasis to plane surveying. The course will make students able to learn and understand the theory and field procedures by applying suitable surveying methods to prepare engineering maps.
