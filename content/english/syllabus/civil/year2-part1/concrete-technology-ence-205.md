## Course Objectives

The objective of this course is to build the basic understanding of students on concrete ingredients and their properties, properties of fresh and hardened concrete, quality assurance and quality control in concreting works, concrete grade and concrete mix design, and special concrete. After completing this course, students should be able to develop competency in understanding on behavior of concrete, concreting operation, tests on concrete, and mix design.

## Course Content

### 1. Concrete and Constituents of Concrete (6 hours)
1.1 Introduction to concrete and use of concrete in structures  
1.2 Constituents of concrete  
1.2.1 Aggregates (Properties and their gradation)

1.2.3 Water (Quality/requirements of water for concrete)  
1.2.4 Admixtures: Chemical admixtures and mineral admixtures, use of chemical admixtures (Plasticizers, Super-plasticizers, accelerator, retarder, air entraining agents, water proofer), properties, use and different types of mineral admixtures (Fly ash, blast furnace slag, silica fume, rice husk ash, meta-kaolin)  
1.3 Structure of concrete: Concrete as three phase system (aggregate, hydrated cement paste and transition zone phases)

### 2. Properties of Fresh Concrete and Concreting Operations (4 hours)
2.1 Water-cement ratio  
2.2 Workability and its tests (Slump test, compaction factor test, Vee-Bee consistency test, flow table test)  
2.3 Segregation, bleeding and their effects  
2.4 Concreting operations (Batching, mixing, handling, placing, compaction, finishing, curing and formwork removal)

4.5 Effect of gel/space ratio  
4.6 Concrete maturity  
4.7 Durability of concrete: Physical and chemical cause of deterioration, effect of water and permeability, sulphate attack, attack by sea water, alkali silica reaction (AAR/ASR), chloride ion penetration, carbonation, corrosion of steel in concrete

### 5. Testing of Concrete, Quality Assurance and Quality Control (5 hours)
5.1 Strength of concrete (Tensile, compressive, shear and bond strength)  
5.2 Compressive strength test  
5.3 Tensile strength test (Direct, splitting and flexural)

6. Non-destructive testing (Schmidt rebound hammer test and ultrasonic pulse velocity test)

## Final Exam
The questions will cover all the chapters in the syllabus. The evaluation scheme will be as indicated in the table below:

| Chapter | Hours | Mark distribution* |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 6 | 6 |
| 2 | 4 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 | 6 |
| 4 | 6 | 6 |
| 5 | 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 3 | 3 |
| **Total** | **30** | **30** |

* There may be minor deviation in marks distribution.
