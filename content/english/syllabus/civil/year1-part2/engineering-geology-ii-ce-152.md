## Course Objectives

The course will provide the fundamental knowledge of engineering geology to the civil engineering students. Students will be able to measure the geological data from the field, analyze and interpret them for the development of civil infrastructures, for their stability and to provide input design parameters.

## Field works (2 days)

A two-days fieldwork to provide practical on-site knowledge of engineering geology in any one of the road/highway projects under construction or have severe geo-hazard problem/any one of the hydropower projects under construction. Students submit report after the fieldwork (Attendance in Fieldwork is Compulsory).
